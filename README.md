## It does...

Saves one position for you to return to, as many times as you need.

It is composed of two commands:

1.  `save_back_there` (`Ctrl, Shift, q`) - Saves the current position of the text cursor in the current window

2.  `go_back_there` (`Ctrl, q`) - Places the cursor _back_ _there_, where it was last saved

__New:__ commit [43825a1f9b](https://github.com/iuliux/SublimeText2-BackThere/commit/43825a1f9b79d5e88ca00541995b5fa388177fbc) introduces:  
When no position is saved in the current file, a jump to the latest globally saved position will be performed (this involving a switch to that other file's view) if at least one saved position exists in the current session (since the editor was started).


## Default key bingings

1.  Save command: 

    `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `q`

2.  Go command:

    `Ctrl` + `q`

For OSX, replace `Ctrl` with `Control` (not `Command`)

To use your custom (and probably better) key bindings, you should either add them in `Preferences -> Key bindings - User` like in the example below, either edit the `Default (<operating-system>).sublime-keymap` file in the plugin's folder.

    { "keys": ["shift+ctrl+q"], "command": "save_back_there" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+q"], "command": "go_back_there" }

## Installing (with PackageControl)

(Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) plugin)

Invoke Package Control (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`), enter Install command and pick `Back There`

## Installing (without PackageControl)

If you don't have `git` installed, you can just download as Zip, and unpack it.
